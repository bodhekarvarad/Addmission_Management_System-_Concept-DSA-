# Addmission_Management_System-_Concept-DSA-

This is a simple C program that uses a **stack data structure** to manage student information, suitable for diploma-level projects. It demonstrates how stack operations like `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `display` can be applied to real-world scenarios such as storing and managing student data.

---

## 💡 Features

- Stack-based storage (LIFO/FILO)
- Insert (`push`) and remove (`pop`) student records
- View top entry (`peek`) or all records (`display`)
- Search for a student by name
- Structure-based data storage
- Menu-driven interface

---

## 🧾 Student Information Stored

Each student record includes:

1. Name  
2. Date of Birth  
3. Gender  
4. Family Income  
5. 10th Percentage  
6. Institute Name  
7. Branch Name  
8. Academic Year  
9. Total Fee  
10. Paid Fee  
11. Remaining Fee

## ⚙️ Stack Operations Used

- `push()` – Add student data to the stack  
- `pop()` – Remove the most recent entry  
- `peek()` – See the latest student without removing  
- `display()` – View all student data  
- `isEmpty()` – Check if the stack is empty  
- `isFull()` – Check if the stack is full

## 📌 Algorithm Overview

1. **Start**
2. Define a structure for student information
3. Accept student details one by one using `push`
4. Use a loop and `switch` to offer options to the user:
    - Add (push) student
    - Search student by name
    - Exit the program
5. Display appropriate messages if:
    - Stack is full (Overflow)
    - Stack is empty (Underflow)
    - Student not found
6. **End**
